Basic Classification with Logistic Regression


















This repository includes examples and scripts for building a simple classification model using logistic regression to predict binary outcomes. Whether you're predicting customer churn, classifying emails, or analyzing medical data, these tools provide a foundational approach to machine learning classification tasks.
























Key Features:




















Logistic Regression: Implement a probabilistic model that predicts binary outcomes based on input variables.


















Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score



























Data Preprocessing: Handle data preprocessing steps such as feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing values.





























These examples demonstrate how to train a model, make predictions, and evaluate its performance using commonly used metrics.



























Explore the scripts and documentation to integrate basic classification tasks into your machine learning workflows.
